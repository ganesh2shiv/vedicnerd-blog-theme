**Note: It's not responsive. So it probably won't look good on mobile devices.**

(I know it sucks. But you can check out [this link](https://github.com/PotHix/manifest-wordpress-theme-responsive) if it helps. And [here's the github link](https://github.com/jbarraud/Manifest) of the original Manifest theme)
